	* utilities/polybench.h: Cast all integer variables as unsigned
	long long int in all POLYBENCH_ALLOC_xxx array size macros, to
	match the type of polybenc_alloc_data().

2017-03-05  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <pouchet@colostate.edu>

	* utilities/polybench.c: Clear PAPI eventset before starting a new
	event (needed with latest version of PAPI to properly handle non-
	multiplexable counters).

	* polybench.c: Fix PAPI compilation problem, and change in API for
	PAPI 5.4.3

	* CHANGELOG,
	* LICENSE.txt,
	* README: Fix minor typos to prepare for polybench 4.2.

2016-04-19 Tomofumi Yuki <tomofumi.yuki@inria.fr>
	* utilities/makefile-gen.pl: Fixed a bug in Makefile generation where
	EXTRA_FLAGS was not used. Reported by Willy Wolff <willy.mh.wolff@gmail.com>.
	* gemver: Fixed the definition of x in gemver; was missing a transpose. The
	C implementation was correct but the R version and the pdf was not.
	* syr2k: This kernel was doing twice the work due to missing constraint on
	j loop. It did not affect the output due to symmetry.
	* gemm,gesummv,syrk,syr2k,2mm,3mm: Updated the input generation to avoid
	some zeros in the output.
	* trisolv: Fixed the R implementation that was not working due to a typo.

2015-12-14 Tomofumi Yuki <tomofumi.yuki@inria.fr>
	* utilities/polybench.c: Fixed the typo introduced in the previous change.
	The reduction clause was written as (tmp:+) where it should have been (+:tmp).
	Reported by Sven Verdoolaege <sven.verdoolaege@gmail.com>.

	* Fixed issues with SCALAR_VAL macro in gessummv,2mm,3mm,atax,bicg,doitgen,durbin,gramschmidt,adi (reported by Sven)
	* Simplified macros for data type changes.
		- new macros DATA_TYPE_IS_XXX now takes care of all other macros (printf specifier, sqrt,pow,exp)
		- affectted files are all headers of the kernels + header-gen.pl
	* Updated README with the above
		- plus removed gauss-filter from the list of kernels
